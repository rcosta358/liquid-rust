Very simple liquid type checker for Rust that performs straightforward compile-time checks for numerical constants using the `refine!` procedural macro.
Uses Logos and LALRPOP to parse the refinement string into a tiny AST and translates it into SMT formulas using the Z3 SMT solver.

### Examples

With the procedural macro `refine!`, it's possible to check if a value satisfies a refinement condition at compile-time:

```rust
use liquid_rust::refine;

fn main() {
    let val1 = refine!("(_ > 0 && _ < 10) || _ == -1", -1); // between 0 and 10 or exactly -1
    let val2 = refine!("_ * 10 < 100", 9); // less than 100 when multiplied by 10
    let val3 = refine!("_ % 2 == 0 ? _ >= 0 : _ < 0", -7); // positive evens or negative odds
    let val4 = refine!("_ == 10 ? true : _ > 0 ? !(_ >= 10) : false", 5); // between 0 and 10
}
```

It is also possible to annotate constants with the `#[refinement("...")]` attribute which wraps the constant in a `refine!` call:

```rust
use liquid_rust::refinement;

#[refinement("_ > 0")]
const X: i32 = 1;
```

### Limitations
- Only supports numerical constants
- Checks made only at definition
- No support for runtime checks

This is not a practical project to be used, as it is no useful at all. It is just a fun experiment to learn more about this topic.
